To use this you'll need Melon Loader as an injector, you can find this online if you search MelonLoader, go on their website which is https://melonwiki.xyz/#/README?id=manual-installation and get the automated install one unless you're weird and want to install it manually then get the 64bit version, once done launch it go to your Pixel Worlds directory and install it there, once you've done this then run & close the game and put the .dll in the Mod folder which will be located in the same place where you've installed Pixel Worlds.

Will I release the source for this? No I most likely won't, nobody will have the source at all except from me as I feel like people will just take the source and add a stealer to the cheats so I won't be releasing it so you don't get scumbags going around scamming others for their accounts or items.

Why does this lack some basic features such as Anti-Bounce etc? Well I haven't hooked any functions for this cheat, I've only called functions and manipulated results of other functions, if I knew how to I would but Harmony Patcher is confusing me, I haven't really looked into any tutorials on how to hook/patch functions that much as I can't get my head around it, either way this may be annoying but they're simple to create in Cheat Engine, may make a tutorial on it if people really care or want one, most of these cheats on here won't be amazingly useful as I'm a troll and farming or anything like that won't bother me so yeah.

Why am I releasing this? As much as I love Pixel Worlds it's being more boring lately with the lack of frequent updates or at least a major update or new items and I also just can't play this game much, it's sad to see how people get scammed by stealers still so I thought why not just make my private cheat public and like I said I won't be releasing source so nobody can turn this into a stealer.

Will I improve this, yeah I will if anyone wants to DM me I don't mind adding some stuff or trying to add stuff if I get any ideas and may also make a version for lowe resoultion as there is a toggle UI on the far right of the screen you won't be able to see without 2560x1440 resoultion

Buttons
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
• Logout of any account, no need to use registery unless you want to stop PW from tracking your account information across other accoutns

• Continous Jump, it's obvious it allows you to hold down the jump button to jump

• Status Cards & Status Trade this is just for trolling to be honest

• Pet Choo-Choo, Pet Love, Pet Follow these are all the pet emotes (I think) or at least the ones I can use just nice animations

•Annoying Audio this will play well whats in the name just annoying audio of someone bouncing which is funny for trolling I guess

• Sleep animation puts you to sleep

• Fire Death, Frost Death, Electric Death

• Join a fishing tournament from anywhere (Baby Cup Tournament I Think Or Pro Fisher?)

• Play Music, if you don't like the music in the world then stop whining and put on spotify or change it, this is just a filler for the menu never even used it, still questioning why I've added it

• Add Bytes, Add Gems this is visual but for the funny I guess

•Reload Player, this will reload your player, spawn you back to spawn basically just had it to get it spawn faster and also to reset my character as it bugged when making cheats more than a bit

• Set Spawn POS, won't set real spawn only sets Reload Player as I was testing stuff, might remove later

• Repeat Portal (Not going to lie I forgot what this did)

• Enter Worlds this allows you to enter a world and enter a portal within that world if you have a portal ID, you can get the portal IDs yourself if you have a brain but I normally use this to bypass worlds or P2P worlds which have levelled doors

• Quest Complete, I always make alt accounts so this just makes the game think I've collected a quest from Pixel Station to complete one of the tutorial quests

• Player ID, this gives you your player ID, copies it to your clipboard, I use this as I need the ID for some cheats

• Player Data, this will give you information about the account you're on, not amazingly useful but just nice to have as why not?

• Item List, this prints out the Item List of all new items so you won't need to rely on people leaking it as you can just check it yourself

• Entry List, this gives you the list of everybody in the world & also their IDs

• Free Repair, I think this is bugged or did work before, it'll repair your pickaxe if you put it into a prizebox for free as it should set it to max durability but I can't remember not going to lie

• Last Active this gives you World Decay dates and copies them to your clipboard like if I went into PixelStation it'd say World Name: PIXELSTATION Owner's Last Logged In Date: 28/12/2022 10:40:59

• Custom MSG, this will let you type to the console up to 640 characters which is like 4-5x the games normal text limit, I wouldn't use this on your main account though as they'll most likely permamently ban you or do ban you either way, don't use it on your main unless you want to risk a ban

• Change Set this literally just visually changes your set, nothing special just bored

• Report All so this reports everybody in the world for offensive language, this will disconnect you if you spam it too much (this should work but not 100% sure)

• Add All you know what it does but don't spam it as it'll disconnect you

• Summon All you know what it does but don't spam it as it'll disconnect you

• Trade All you know what it does but don't spam it as it'll disconnect you

• CardBattle All, this works but is laggy as you're trying to card battle everybody in the world

• Kick All you know what it does but don't spam it as it'll disconnect you

• Ban All you know what it does but don't spam it as it'll disconnect you

• Finish Line this just makes it so if you click it you'll finish the race instantly without needing to actually complete it so if I went to do a parkour, there was a start line bot then if I go over it, click the button I would've completed it instantly

• Reload World this just allows you to reload it as sometimes you'll bug when loading into worlds, don't spam it too but I also use this for reloading Nether as I'm lazy and Boss Finder/Milk Finder won't reload it for you if you've found a boss/milk

• Seng MSG, this just sends a copy & pasta message, I think it's a Patrick Bateman one?

• Sit Anim, this is the sit animation so it'll allow you to sit on others if they're already on it too also allows you to sit on a electric chair

• Invis Animation, this is the animation to get into things like coffins or anything that fully hides you, it'll work on the throne of swords & coffins which kill you

• Boss Finder if you're in the Nether then just click this everytime you've loaded in, it'll reload the Nether and try to join another world if you don't find a boss, it'll stop letting you reload once one is found

• Milk Finder which is the same as Boss Finder basically

• Anti-DMG On, this I don't think entirely works as it just freezes the enmies but is what it is, it'll only freeze them on your screen though and not others (obviously)

• Kill All, this will visually kill all the enemies in the Nether for you or Pixel Mines, you may need to spam it a few times though but they'll be gone only downside is you can't kill them for gems but if you're so bothered just use it on low level mines if you can't be arsed killing any enemies

• Access List this gives you the list of players who have access to World Locks & also Smaller Locks (Large, Medium, Small etc)

• Join Mine this allows you to join a level 1 mine without being at the world, nothing useful just there for laziness

Toggle Features

• Randomize Character, this will change your skin colour & flag at the same time

• Chat Commands, allows people to control you with stuff like /frostdeath, /firedeath, /rainbow, /jump, /right, /left, /jumpright, /jumpleft chat commands are laggy though as I'm using the in game function for it, for some reason it'll duplicate the commands being sent and also miss out some commands being sent

• Chat Logger, logs chat but it's buggy 

• Auto-Replace Blocks this will replace stuff like spikebombs, sawblade and spikes but for some reason it'll bug out and replace stuff that isn't it do I know why? Probably the function is being called too quickly

• Clone Chat, it'll show a text box to enter a players name in, once done it'll try and copy what they say (needs to be fully correct with caps etc)

•Player Hit this just makes it so you get hit or so your skin turns red I guess

• Tutorial Skip, this allows you to skip the part where you need to buy clothes so straight after you pickup the gems which you've got from breaking blocks

• Copy & Pasta of Patrick Bateman & also Walter White's confession because why the hell not?

• NPC Bot, it's buggy but funny and I was bored so if it's afk for 15 seconds or more it'll send a message if someone says what quest then it'll respond with information about some random ass quest which is non-existent, why? Why not.
